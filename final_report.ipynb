                "This project aimed to design and benchmark a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Classifier for credit card fraud detection. Using PennyLane and PyTorch, we built a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) capable of processing real-world financial data. Despite the dataset's high class imbalance (only 8% fraud), our optimized Quantum model achieved a **69% Recall rate**, successfully identifying the majority of fraud cases and outperforming the naive Classical Neural Network baseline.\n",
